\section{The Product}
\spec{An analysis and critical evaluation of the quality of the WACC compiler you have built. You should consider both whether it meets the functional specification and whether you judge that it forms a sound basis for future development. You may wish to address performance issues.}
...
\begin{itemize}
\item Frontend was really good - meets specification very well
\item Frontend made a strong base for building into the backend
\item Backend is mostly functional, few cases that it fails (examples, modifying strings)
\item Backend emphasises function over form - unoptimised
\item 'Hacks' in backend that we did that should be removed (e.g. adding to the stack pointer after every variable declaration, duplicate strings, ect.)
\item Easy to add extra function to the compiler
\item Hard to add some compiler optimisations due to instructions knowing little about the program state
\end{itemize}

\section{The Project Management}
\spec{An analysis of the organisation of your group and your use of project management tools (such as Git). You should describe how your group was structured, how you coordinated your work and detail any tools that helped/hindered your progress. You should also discuss what went well and what you would do differently if you were to do the lab again.}
...
\begin{itemize}
\item Master branch only has functional code
\item Each person had an individual branch
\item Merged into development
\item Once development worked, pushed into master
\item Worked on general program structure together
\item Split into individuals/pairs, split up instructions
\item Wrote test suite in ruby, based on labTS
\item Floating point vfpv3 arm emulator
\item Good git use - merges were easy
\item Start work earlier
\end{itemize}

\section{The Design Choices}
\spec{An analysis of the design choices that you made during the WACC lab. You should discuss the design patterns you used when designing your code and why you chose to use them.}
...
\begin{itemize}
\item Frontend walks tree with antlr generated visitor pattern
\item Error listener catches and handles syntax errors
\item Backend walks tree with second visitor pattern
\item Builds new tree of instructions
\item Walks tree to generate assembly
\item LabelMaker uses singleton pattern to avoid duplicate labels + allow static access
\end{itemize}

\section{Beyond the Specification}
\spec{An evaluation of your extensions to your WACC compiler. You should describe all of the language extensions, optimisations or other aspects that you have added to your compiler, including how these features can be accessed or viewed. You should also briefly discuss what future extensions you would like to add to your WACC compiler if you had more time.}
...
\begin{itemize}
\item elif + optional else
\item break/continue
\item floating point
\item imports
\item pointers
\end{itemize}
